Welcome to the homepage of the **Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata**, an independent research centre within the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en) which has the aim of gathering, managing, distributing and studying the complex domain of scholarly [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata). 

The Research Centre provides a formal administrative centre to handle [OpenCitations](http://opencitations.net), an independent infrastructure organization for open scholarship dedicated to the publication of open bibliographic and citation data. The Research Centre has an [International Advisory Board for OpenCitations](/board) drawn from leaders within the main bibliographic stakeholder communities of relevance to ensure that OpenCitations' original aim of free provision of open bibliographic and citation data, services and software is maintained.
